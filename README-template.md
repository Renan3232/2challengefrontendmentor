## My process-
So I've started with the mobile design, adding structure to HTML and then styling it, then I've used CSS to style the HTML, trying to make it as similiar as possible of the layout, and I added @media queries to style the desktop design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- @media queries
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned
During this challenge I could understant better many concepts of Css and Html, it opened my mind for selectors, paddings, box-sizing, which is really important when we are positioning our content. 
I've have aslo used max-width!



### Continued development
I want to keep improving in many aspects, but firstly, I want to build a strong base, being able to undenstand and to aplly the basics concepts, then scaling up my skiils.
Making the code shorter is one of the things that I'm trying to keep an eye open to.



### Useful resources

- [w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I basically used just this source over this challenge, it helped me to remeber some basic but import aspects of my code, such as Padding, Margin, box-sizing.
